# SelfBuffTracker

**SelfBuffTracker** is a lightweight, customizable World of Warcraft addon designed to keep track of missing self-buffs (like _Mark of the Wild_, _Well Fed_, flasks, or stances) and alert you before you enter combat without them.

***

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Multi-Buff Tracking:** Track as many buffs or spells as you want simultaneously.
*   **Drag & Drop Position:** Easily unlock and move the display frame anywhere on your screen.
*   **Spellbook & Chat Integration:** Quickly add or remove spells by **Shift-clicking** them directly from your Spellbook or chat links into the command line.
*   **Audio Alerts:** Plays a clear warning sound when you are missing buffs upon entering combat or at regular intervals.
*   **Per-Character Profiles:** Each character maintains its own independent list of tracked buffs and settings.
*   **Minimalist & Clean UI:** Dynamic icon frames that scale and auto-adjust based on how many buffs are currently missing.
*   **Buff Groups:** Group alternative buffs (e.g. different flasks) so they show as a single reminder icon that disappears as soon as any one of them is active — no more duplicate reminders for buffs that serve the same purpose.

## 💻 Chat Commands

Use `/sbt` or `/buff` in chat to configure the addon:

*   `/sbt add [Spell Link or Name]` – Adds a buff to track _(Tip: Shift-click from your Spellbook!)_
*   `/sbt remove [Spell Link or Name]` – Removes a buff from tracking
*   `/sbt list` – Displays all currently tracked buffs in your chat frame
*   `/sbt lock` – Toggles frame locking (unlocks the container to move it via drag & drop)
*   `/sbt sound` – Toggles audio warning alerts ON/OFF
*   `/sbt size [number]` – Changes the icon size (Default: `50`)
*   `/sbt group create [Name]` – Creates a new buff group
*   `/sbt group add [Name] [Spell Link or Name]` – Adds a buff to a group (tracks it if it isn't already)
*   `/sbt group remove [Name] [Spell Link or Name]` – Removes a buff from a group
*   `/sbt group delete [Name]` – Deletes a group (its buffs stay tracked, just ungrouped)
*   `/sbt group list` – Lists all groups and their members

Groups can also be managed from the settings UI (`/sbt options`) under **Tracked Buffs → Buff groups**, including assigning a buff to a group from a dropdown and picking which group member's icon is displayed.
